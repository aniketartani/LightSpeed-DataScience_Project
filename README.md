<h2>Improvements in the future for the present system:</h2>
<p>Need to increase our data set so that Linear Regression can give us more accurate values.<br>
More Graphical patters can be inserted for analyzing it in a more better way.<br>
For making it more useful need to implement ML algorithms.<br>
